# Delhi Cab Venture — Project Context (for AI assistants)

> Read this file first. It is **self-contained** — everything an AI needs to work on

> `index.html` to understand the project.

## What this is

A **single-page static website** that presents a **business proposal**: a 5-partner
shared investment to run a **CNG cab fleet in Delhi**, starting with one car and
scaling to a small fleet over 5 years. It is an internal pitch document for the
partners, not a web app.

- **No build step. No dependencies. No framework.** One self-contained HTML file with
  inline `<style>` and a tiny inline `<script>` (an IntersectionObserver for scroll
  fade-in animations). Fonts load from Google Fonts via `<link>`.
- Open `index.html` directly in any browser to view it.

`index.html` was originally named `delhi-cab-proposal.html`; renamed to `index.html`
so GitHub Pages (or any static host) serves it at the site root. The two HTML pages
cross-link via their nav bars (each is self-contained — its own inlined CSS/JS).

### Proposal 2 — `fleet-investment-plan.html`
A separate, deliberately **realistic/honest** companion analysis. Same design system as
Proposal 1. Structured in 7 sections (page-num `NN / 07`): 01 the three money questions,
02 investment-options table, 03 capital-per-car, **04 the headline: 5-car break-even**,
05 scale-to-10 roadmap + verdict, 06 reality check, 07 assumptions. All figures are
rounded planning estimates, stated as such in the page. Key modelled conclusions:
- Investment-instrument comparison (FD/RD/debt fund/gold/**equity SIP ~12% = engine**).
- Per-car: **₹2.2 L launch cash** + ₹6 L loan @9%/5yr (EMI ₹12,450, self-paid by the car).
  Net per car **(incl. ~₹2,000/mo parking) ~₹3K/mo under loan → ~₹14K/mo once its loan clears**.
- **5-car path (cautious):** add 1 car/yr, total **₹11 L invested (₹2.2 L/partner)**;
  **break-even ≈ Year 7** (~6.5 yrs); deepest drawdown −₹5.6 L (~₹1.12 L/partner) at Year 5.
  (Parking pushed break-even out ~1 yr & deepest hole from Yr 3 to Yr 5 — thin margins.)
- **10-car path (ambitious):** ~₹3 L/partner (~₹5K/mo), ~₹40 L fleet debt at peak;
  verdict **profit** — ~₹10 L/partner over Yr 6–10 + asset share (~3–5× decade), but only
  ~2× a passive SIP once effort/leverage/risk are priced in.
- Recommendation: **build to 5 cars first**, push to 10 only if drivers/utilization are
  under control by Year 3; keep a benchmark SIP running.
- Realism baked in: replacement treadmill (~7-yr taxi life), driver-scaling as the true
  ceiling, utilization sensitivity, leverage, possible EV-mandate capex shock.

### Doc 3 — `partnership-rules.html`
The founding **partnership charter** (Draft v1) — the rules for how 3–6 members join,
invest, share profit, run the cab and decide things. Same design system. 26 numbered
rules across 7 sections (Members/Ownership, Money, 6-Month Test & Exit, Operations,
Personal Use, Governance, Leaving/Changes) + a sign-off block. Each rule is tagged
**`Draft v1`** (the user's original 9 rules) or **`Proposed`** (additions I suggested for
fairness — voting/transparency/roles/exit/capital-calls etc., to be ratified by the group).
Framed as a living, changeable document; ends with a disclaimer to formalize in a
registered partnership deed (not legal advice). User will gather members' feedback.

### Doc 4 — `rental-platforms-research.html`
A research note (web-searched June 2026) on platforms/channels to rent the car to a
driver on daily rent (~₹1,000–1,200/day): Ola "Attach My Car"/Operator (best fit, lease
₹700–1,150/day), Uber Fleet Partner, Everest Fleet (benchmark — they own cars), and the
informal local driver networks/FB groups (where most ₹1,000–1,200/day deals actually
happen). Flags Zoomcar/Revv/Myles as the *wrong* (self-drive) model. Includes a
requirements/safeguards section (yellow plate, commercial insurance, deposit, written
agreement, GPS) and a Sources list. Same design system; cross-linked from index nav.

## Page sections (in document order)

1. **Hero** — headline + key stats (₹1.6L/partner, ₹570/mo Y1 return, 5 cars Y3).
2. `#opportunity` (01/06) — market size, online-booking %, CNG fuel savings.
3. `#car` (02/06) — **vehicle choice: Maruti WagonR Tour CNG** (~₹7–7.5L, 34 km/kg).
   Rejects Alto (too small), Dzire (pricier), Innova (too costly to start).
4. `#ev` (02B · ALTERNATIVE) — **EV-vs-CNG comparison** (Tata Xpres-T EV). Added later.
   Head-to-head table, cash-flow delta, 4 EV-specific risk cards, CNG-vs-EV verdict.
5. `#investment` (03/06) — ₹46K/partner upfront, ₹6L loan, EMI ₹12,450/mo, bank options.
6. `#profit` (04/06) — monthly P&L: ₹96K revenue, ₹93,150 cost (incl. ₹2,000 parking),
   ₹2,850 net (₹570/partner), 2-shift model.
6b. `#cost` (04B) — running-cost basis (₹12.3/km, ₹153/hr, ₹2,455/day, profit excluded)
    + Delhi Govt-meter vs Uber/Ola per-hour fare comparison (~₹6/hr real margin).
7. Growth plan (05/06) — 1 car (Y1) → 8 cars (Y5).
8. `#licenses` (06/06) — permits, licenses, document checklists.
9. `#timeline` — 30-day launch roadmap.
10. Risks — driver, accident, app commission, partner disputes.
11. `#models` — 3 operation models (Own Driver / Own Driver+Incentive / Rent-to-Driver)
    + a "Rent-to-Driver ₹1,000–1,200/day" math block: owner fixed cost ₹20K/mo
    (EMI+maint+insurance+misc), break-even ~17–20 rented days, ~₹10K/mo profit at
    ₹1,200×25 days (₹2K/partner) → ~₹22.5K/mo after loan cleared. Beats own-driver.
12. Closing + footer.

> Note: page numbers are hand-written labels (`01/06` … `06/06`). The EV section uses
> `02B · ALTERNATIVE` to avoid renumbering the rest. If you add a numbered section,
> either keep this "letter suffix" style or renumber every `.page-num` consistently.

## Key facts / numbers (so you don't have to re-derive them)

- **All figures are planning estimates**, framed as such in the document. CNG/EV prices
  and the Delhi EV Policy change over time — flag estimates and tell the user to confirm
  live prices with a dealer rather than inventing precise current values.
- CNG running cost ≈ ₹2.2/km; EV ≈ ₹1.0/km (home/depot charging).
- EV (Tata Xpres-T) is ~₹9,000/mo cheaper to run but EMI is ~₹7,250/mo higher → net
  ≈ +₹1,750/mo **only if it covers full daily km**. The core EV risk is **range vs the
  2-shift, 200 km/day model** — a charging car earns ₹0.
- Loan/SSH/identity details are in the **Git & hosting** section below.

## Design system (match this when editing — keep edits visually consistent)

Defined as CSS custom properties in `:root` at the top of `index.html`:

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--gold` / `--gold-light` | `#C9A84C` / `#E8C97A` | primary accent, headings, highlights |
| `--dark` / `--dark2` / `--dark3` / `--dark4` | `#0A0A0F` → `#22222E` | backgrounds (cards use `--dark2`) |
| `--white` | `#F5F3EE` | body text |
| `--muted` | `#8A8A9A` | secondary text |
| `--green` / `--red` / `--accent` | `#4CAF84` / `#E05A5A` / `#5B8CFF` | income/expense/info |

- **Fonts:** `Playfair Display` (serif headings), `DM Sans` (body), `DM Mono` (numbers/specs).
- **Reusable classes:** `.section`, `.section-label`, `.section-title`, `.section-desc`,
  `.scale-table` (comparison tables), `.risk-grid`/`.risk-card`, `.car-card`, `.pnl-*`,
  `.page-num`, `.divider`, `.fade-up` (add this class to make an element animate in on scroll).
- **Currency** is Indian Rupee `₹`, lakh notation (`₹7.5 L`, `₹1,60,000`).
- Layout is responsive; `@media (max-width: 768px)` collapses grids to single column.

### Editing conventions
- Keep everything in the **one file** — do not split CSS/JS out or add a build step.
- Reuse existing classes/tokens; avoid introducing new colors or fonts.
- New scroll-animated blocks need `class="fade-up"` to be observed by the script.
- Sections are separated by `<div class="divider"></div>`.

## Git & hosting

- **Remote:** `origin` → `git@dvaitai:DvaitAI-tech/vehical_bussiness.git`
  - Uses the SSH host alias **`dvaitai`** from `~/.ssh/config` (key `~/.ssh/git_dvaitAi`).
    The machine has 3 GitHub identities; this repo MUST use the `dvaitai` alias, not a
    raw `github.com` URL, so the correct key is selected.
- **Commit identity (repo-local, not global):** `DvaitAI <nk.dvaitai@gmail.com>`.
- **Default branch:** `master`.
- **Hosting status:** repo is **private**. GitHub Pages does **not** serve from a private
  repo on the free plan. Options discussed: keep private + open locally; private link with
  password via Netlify/Cloudflare Pages; or make the repo public for free GitHub Pages.
  Decision still open — confirm with the user before publishing anything outward-facing.
- Push is performed by the user (they manage the branch). Don't push unless asked.

## Working norms
- Commit messages on this repo end with the project's standard `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
- This is a confidential business proposal with partner financials — treat outward-facing
  actions (publishing, sharing links) as needing explicit confirmation.
